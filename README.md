# Analyzing_Factors_That_Impact_Snapchat_Election_Ad_Impressions
## Background
What factors affect the number of impressions an advertisement receives? Looking at the 2020 election advertisements in the US regardless of political platform from [Snapchat](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/), we can predict this using regression analysis. Specifically, I looked at these factors:
1. Duration 
2. Targeted Gender (if a specific gender was targeted)
3. Targeted Age (if a specific age group was targeted)
4. Amount Spent 

## Multiple Regression
To find the relationship between these variables and impression, I conducted a multiple regression analysis.
